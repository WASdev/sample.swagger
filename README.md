# Using Swagger in Liberty [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.swagger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.swagger)

This sample contains a few ways of how to use Swagger documentation within Liberty. This application contains
two individual servlets:  the JAX-RS servlet is used to handle requests to a Tasks API, which allows user to create, view and delete Task objects, while the second servlet is an extension of a HTTPServlet and is used to resond to requests for a Contacts API.
Contacts API lets you create, view and update Contact objects.

[TasksResource](/swagger-sample/src/main/java/net/wasdev/swaggersample/jaxrs/TasksResource.java) is a
JAX-RS resouce classs that uses both JAX-RS and Swagger annotations to document the API.

Documentation for HTTPServlet based API [ContactsServlet](/swagger-sample/src/main/java/net/wasdev/swaggersample/servlet/ContactsServlet.java)
is provided using Swagger stub file [swagger.json](/swagger-sample/src/main/webapp/META-INF/stub/swagger.json)

## Getting Started

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself:
* [Building and running on the command line](/docs/Using-cmd-line.md)
* [Building and running using Eclipse and WebSphere Development Tools (WDT)](/docs/Using-WDT.md)

Once the server has been started, go to [REST API Discovery](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2016/02/17/exposing-liberty-rest-apis-swagger/) Explorer at [https://localhost:9444/ibm/api/explorer/](https://localhost:9444/ibm/api/explorer/)
to interact with the sample. Default credentials are login: user, password: demo

## Running with Gradle

This project can also be built and run with [Gradle]. The provided `build.gradle` file applies the [Liberty Gradle Plug-in] and is configured to automatically download and install the Liberty Java EE Web Profile 7 runtime from Maven Central. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in has built-in tasks that can be used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server.

Use the following steps to run the application with Gradle:

1. Execute the full Gradle build. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in will download and install the Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ gradle clean build
    ```

2. To start the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyStart
    ```

    Alternatively, execute the run command:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyRun --no-daemon
    ```

Once the server has started, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.jsonp](http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.jsonp).

3. To stop the server, execute:
    ```bash
    $ gradle libertyStop
    ```
